         <p>
           My name is Salman. I am 20 years old. I was born in Mandi Bahauddin, Pakistan, but I am currently living in Manchester with my parents and a sister. I moved to Italy at the age of 5 and attended my primary and secondary at Rodari school. I completed my GCSEs and levels 3 Engineering diploma in the UK. I am currently studying Computer Science BSc at The University of Manchester. My primary interests are Mathematics, Web-development, and cosmology/astronomy. I have experience creating websites using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I have also been part of web-based projects with my team members at the University (check my <a href="
           portfolio.html"> Portfolio</a> for more).

          <h3>Why CS?</h3>
          <p>
            I coded at the age of 15 for the first time. I programmed a tiny piece of hardware made of LEDs, called Microbit. I used MakeCode software to input a message based on some letters and sounds. I also programmed a line-follower car using Arduino. Ever since then I have been involved with computers and coding. I decided Computer Science to be career path after I finished my GCSEs.

         <h2>Peer Mentoring for Mathematics and Physics</h2><h4>The Manchester College</h4>
         <p class="des">As a mentor, I was able to establish an honest and respectful relationship with my students and provide support, guidance, and feedback to obtain desired outcomes. I always tried to be friendly, and I made my students believe that they have the necessary skills and experience to achieve their goals. I made a genuine commitment to mentoring while I had to manage my own education. With some long working days and excellent time management, I was able to accomplish my aim. </p>
