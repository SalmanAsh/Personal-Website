              <p>Academic Writing: The essay</p>
              <p>I was given one source, an ebook, for this coursework. My task was to find four other sources based on computers, artificial intelligence or robotics, choose a comman topic from these sources and write a concise 400 word essay. I also had to learn Harward referencing to credit the sources. I wrote about how data, such as images, texts and videos, are stored in the storage on a computer. In addition, I explained why computers do not use decimal system anymore. </p>
